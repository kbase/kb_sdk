OVERVIEW
-----------------------------------------
The KBase SDK is a set of tools for developing new modules
that can be dynamically registered and run on the KBase
platform.  Modules include all code, specification files, and
documentation needed to define and run a set of methods
in the KBase Narrative interface.

VERSION: 1.2.6 (Released 10/2020)
---------------------------------
CHANGES:
- "-t" flag removed from entrypoint commands to enable kb-sdk to be run by github actions.

VERSION: 1.2.5 (Unreleased)
---------------------------------
- `kb-sdk test` no longer can see the docker socket due to a docker permissions issue on the docker socket. By default, the user running in the kb-sdk container now runs as the root user

VERSION: 1.2.4 (Unreleased)
---------------------------------
CHANGES:
- `kb-sdk test` no longer dies on its first run; if the user has the KBASE_TEST_TOKEN environment variable set with their developer token, tests can be run without having to edit the test.cfg file.


VERSION: 1.2.3 (Released 06/2020)
------------------------------------
NEW FEATURES:
- updated kb-sdk Dockerfile to use Java 8, the most recent Docker engine, and Ubuntu 20.04.

VERSION: 1.2.2 (Released 06/2020)
------------------------------------
NEW FEATURES:
- kb-sdk version reports the build time and date of the instance
- kb-sdk can use the environment variable KBASE_TEST_TOKEN if a test token is not present in the test.cfg file
- GitHub Actions now used to run basic tests on initialising and testing new base and sample repos.

BUG FIXES:
- Corrected a class name in the generated tests for the Java SDK module.

VERSION: 1.2.1 (Released 12/04/2018)
------------------------------------
CHANGES:
- Now example modules will also be initialized with a generic KIDL spec rather than one tailored to the example.
- Python implementation uses "logging" modules and example tests are updated to be more pythonic (no getters)

BUGFIXES:
- Module specific clients now correctly call baseclient.py for async jobs. This ensures that retry logic is used.
- Replace "/run" with "/var/run" in generated kb-sdk.sh script because "/run" is missing on some docker installs.
- KBaseReports and AssemblyUtils clients should be installed as async not core

VERSION: 1.2.0 (Released 11/14/2018)
------------------------------------
NEW FEATURES:
- Blank modules initiated with `kb-sdk init` will start with a basic KIDL spec as well as simple code that generates a KBaseReport

CHANGES:
- The autogenerated readme docs have been updated and the `docs` folder is no longer generated by default
- Installed SDK clients now will be installed in `lib/installed_client` to make implementation code easier to find
- Client code in all languages will no longer be generated by default when a module is compiled

BUGFIXES:
- The baseclient.py now has retry logic for transient errors in checking subjob status

VERSION: 1.1.0 (Released 8/x/2018)
------------------------------------

BACKWARDS INCOMPATIBILITIES:

- New python modules will build in Python3, existing modules will have 2/3 compatible autogenerated files

BUGFIXES:

- Modules now run as root inside docker containers. Extra temporary file removal logic was added to account for this change on unix systems

VERSION: 1.0.18 (Released 1/24/2018)
------------------------------------

BACKWARDS INCOMPATIBILITIES:

- R support is now deprecated.

BUGFIXES:

- Fixed Python builds for new modules. make sdkbase is required prior to build.

VERSION: 1.0.17 (Released 8/29/2017)
------------------------------------------

- Travis-CI support in the base kb-sdk and in modules generated using the
  kb-sdk init command
- Updated instructions for developer account
- Updated documentation extensively, as well as Auth2 documentation
- Updates to the testing environment
- "kb-sdk init" now generates a RELEASE_NOTES.md file in new module
