OVERVIEW
-----------------------------------------
The KBase SDK is a set of tools for developing new modules
that can be dynamically registered and run on the KBase
platform.  Modules include all code, specification files, and
documentation needed to define and run a set of methods
in the KBase Narrative interface.

VERSION: 1.2.2 (Released 06/xx/2020)
------------------------------------
NEW FEATURES:
- kb-sdk version reports the build time and date of the instance
- kb-sdk can use the environment variable KBASE_TEST_TOKEN if a test token is not present in the test.cfg file
- GitHub Actions now used to run basic tests on initialising and testing new base and sample repos.

BUG FIXES:
- Java client uses the correct name for KBase report

VERSION: 1.2.0 (Released 11/14/2018)
------------------------------------
NEW FEATURES:
- Blank modules initiated with `kb-sdk init` will start with a basic KIDL spec as well as simple code that generates a KBaseReport

CHANGES:
- The autogenerated readme docs have been updated and the `docs` folder is no longer generated by default
- Installed SDK clients now will be installed in `lib/installed_client` to make implementation code easier to find
- Client code in all languages will no longer be generated by default when a module is compiled

BUGFIXES:
- The baseclient.py now has retry logic for transient errors in checking subjob status

VERSION: 1.1.0 (Released 8/x/2018)
------------------------------------

BACKWARDS INCOMPATIBILITIES:
