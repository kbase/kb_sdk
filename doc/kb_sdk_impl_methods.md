### <A NAME="impl"></A>5. Implement App(s)

In the directory lib/\<MyModule>, edit the \<MyModule>Impl.py (or *Impl.pl or *Server.java) "Implementation" file that 
defines the methods (apps) available in the module. The example module is very simple and is implemented directly in this file
but it is better practice and more readable to separate implementation logic into multiple files, especially for modules 
that include more than one app. 

The workflow of most modules involves obtaining data from the KBase data stores, operating on that data (possibly with 3rd-party 
code or executables), storing resulting data in the data stores, and producing a report for the user summarizing the work accomplished.
This step of the guide will walk through this process and present some of the utility modules that help facilitate this work.

#### <A NAME="install"></A>A. Install Other KBase Modules

If you begin by altering an existing app (as this walkthough demonstrates) you will already have some KBase utility 
modules in your lib directory. To install additional packages run `kb-sdk install <module name>` from the terminal. This operation is case sensitive (but will accept any case of letters and potentially cause errors) so make sure to type the module name with the correct uppercase and lowercase letters.

Here are some of the modules that might be helpful for your app:

* [KBaseReport](https://appdev.kbase.us/#catalog/modules/KBaseReport) - Allows the creation of KBase 
reports which can present text, html, and downloadable files to the user as output to your app.
* [GenomeFileUtil](https://appdev.kbase.us/#catalog/modules/ReadsUtils) - Import/Export and Upload/Download 
of Genome data
* [AssemblyUtils](https://appdev.kbase.us/#catalog/modules/ReadsAlignmentUtils) - Provides tooling for interacting 
with sequence assembly data in KBase.
* [ReadsUtils](https://appdev.kbase.us/#catalog/modules/ReadsUtils) - Utilities for validating, uploading, and 
downloading reads files. Includes FASTA and FASTQ validators. 
* [ExpressionUtils](https://appdev.kbase.us/#catalog/modules/ExpressionUtils) - Upload, download and 
export RNASeq Expression data gemerated by either StringTie or Cufflinks apps.
* [ReadsAlignmentUtils](https://appdev.kbase.us/#catalog/modules/ReadsAlignmentUtils) - Upload and download KBase reads alignment files.
* [DifferentialExpressionUtils](https://appdev.kbase.us/#catalog/modules/DifferentialExpressionUtils) - Upload/download/export differential expression objects and other related processing
* [FeatureSetUtils](https://appdev.kbase.us/#catalog/modules/FeatureSetUtils) - Upload, download and 
export Genomic Feature Set data
* [CompoundSetUtils](https://appdev.kbase.us/#catalog/modules/CompoundSetUtils) - Upload/download/export 
chemical compound sets
* [DataFileUtil](https://appdev.kbase.us/#catalog/modules/DataFileUtil) - A collection of tools to 
get data directly from the web, from the user's computer (via the staging area) or from KBase workspaces.

#### <A NAME="import"></A>B. Import and Initialize
In Python, you can import these installed modules like any other Python package. In the header, two important properties
are defined. The first is the SDK_CALLBACK_URL which is passed to modules invoked by this module so they can report 
their status and results to the callback server which coordinates module execution. This is demonstrated by 
the instantiation of an AssemblyUtil client in the following example.

The other parameter commonly defined in 
the module constructor is the path to the scratch directory. This directory is a common space accessible by not only the 
current module but also every module called by this module. Therefore files from other modules (for example 
AssemblyUtil) will be written to the scratch folder and files to be used by other modules (such as KBaseReport) are 
read from the scratch folder.

```python
import os
from AssemblyUtil.AssemblyUtilClient import AssemblyUtil
from KBaseReport.KBaseReportClient import KBaseReport

class <ModuleName>:
    """Module Docs"""
    def __init__(self, config):
        #BEGIN_CONSTRUCTOR
        self.config = config
        self.scratch = config['scratch']
        self.callback_url = os.environ['SDK_CALLBACK_URL']
        self.dfu = AssemblyUtil(self.callback_url)
        #END_CONSTRUCTOR
        pass
```

#### <A NAME="validate"></A>C. Validating user input

While user interfaces for Narrative apps are able to able to validate input to your app, it's wise not to rely on 
this functionality because other developers may call your module directly (and possibly incorrectly). The following function
can be placed in the header to your app and called to verify the correct keys are present in an input parameter
object. You also should consider type checking and/or deeper input validation, especially for long running apps.
```python
    @staticmethod
    def _check_param(in_params, req_param, opt_param=list()):
        """
        Check if each of the params in the 'req_params' list are in 'in_params' and warn about unexpected params
        """
        for param in req_param:
            if param not in in_params:
                raise ValueError('{} parameter is required'.format(param))
        defined_param = set(req_param+opt_param)
        for param in in_params:
            if param not in defined_param:
                print("WARNING: received unexpected parameter {}".format(param))
```

#### <A NAME="impl-adding-data"></A>D. Adding Reference Data To Your App

Reference data that is modest in size should be added to the GitHub repository in the /data folder. At runtime, this
data will be accessible at `/kb/module/data`. Data sets that exceed GitHub's file size limits (> 100 MB) should be 
added to a shared mount point.  This can be accomplished by contacting KBase administrators (http://kbase.us/contact-us). 

[\[Back to top\]](#top)

#### <A NAME="get-save-data"></A>E. Interacting with KBase data stores (Workspaces)

Your app may use one or more data objects the user has available in a Narrative (visible in the Data Panel) or data objects in public Narratives. Your app can access these objects by reference (preferred) or 
name using the [DataFileUtils](https://narrative.kbase.us/#catalog/modules/DataFileUtil) (DFU) module or a type-specific module that uses DFU under the hood (such as [AssemblyUtil](https://narrative.kbase.us/#catalog/modules/AssemblyUtil))
to handle input and output of objects/files. While any object can be downloaded or uploaded in JSON form with DFU, 
the specialized modules often are able to write or read data in type-specific formats like FASTA or SBML, as the
example module demonstrates:

```
fasta_file = assemblyUtil.get_assembly_as_fasta({'ref': assembly_input_ref})

...

new_assembly = assemblyUtil.save_assembly_from_fasta({'file': {'path': filtered_fasta_file},
                                                      'workspace_name': workspace_name,
                                                      'assembly_name': fasta_file['assembly_name']
                                                      })
```

In order to support open and reproducible science, KBase data objects store a record of the source and methods applied 
to data in an accompanying provenance object. You may find examples of older KBase modules which generate 
[provenance objects](https://ci.kbase.us/services/ws/docs/Workspace.html#typedefWorkspace.ProvenanceAction) directly and
use the workspace service to save objects but this approach has been deprecated in favor of the DFU or type-specific modules
which handle provenance data automatically.

#### <A NAME="impl-shell-tool"></A>F. Invoking Shell Tool

Many KBase apps wrap tools with commandline interfaces. The following example from the [kb_quast](https://github.com/kbaseapps/kb_quast) 
repository demonstrates how to do (and document) this well with Python.

```python
    def run_quast_exec(self, outdir, filepaths, labels):
        threads = psutil.cpu_count() * self.THREADS_PER_CORE
        # DO NOT use genemark instead of glimmer, not open source
        # DO NOT use metaQUAST, uses SILVA DB which is not open source
        cmd = ['quast.py', '--threads', str(threads), '-o', outdir, '--labels', ','.join(labels),
               '--glimmer', '--contig-thresholds', '0,1000,10000,100000,1000000'] + filepaths
        self.log('running QUAST with command line ' + str(cmd))
        retcode = subprocess.call(cmd)
        self.log('QUAST return code: ' + str(retcode))
        if retcode:
            # can't actually figure out how to test this. Give quast garbage it skips the file.
            # Give quast a file with a missing sequence it acts completely normally.
            raise ValueError('QUAST reported an error, return code was ' + str(retcode))
        # quast will ignore bad files and keep going, which is a disaster for
        # reproducibility and accuracy if you're not watching the logs like a hawk.
        # for now use this hack to check that all files were processed. Maybe there's a better way.
        files_proc = len(os.listdir(os.path.join(outdir, 'predicted_genes'))) / 2
        files_exp = len(filepaths)
        if files_proc != files_exp:
            err = ('QUAST skipped some files - {} expected, {} processed.'
                   .format(files_exp, files_proc))
            self.log(err)
            raise ValueError(err)
 ```

#### <A NAME="impl-report"></A>G. Building Output Report

The [KBaseReport](https://appdev.kbase.us/#catalog/modules/KBaseReport) module allows the creation of KBase reports which can present text, HTML, and downloadable files to the user as output to your app. The KBaseReports module is the preferred way to communicate results to users.

*Why do I need to make a report?*

Reports in KBase allow a developer to present visualizations, generate human-readable text strings, show warnings, provide links to output files that do not correspond to typed objects, and in general display information that is useful to a user without having to utilize kbase-ui widgets. 

*What kinds of reports can I make?*

Developers can use the KBaseReports module to display and contain a wide variety of content. It's up to each developer to determine how to creatively and effectively integrate this module with their Apps. Reports can be configured in a variety of ways, depending on how the parameters to parse and display the outputs of an App are configured. We will cover an example and some sample code, but exploring the variety of existing Apps and their output reports within the KBase Narratives will best demonstrate the capabilities of this module. Many developers have used the ability to contain and display HTML files within the reports for visualization of and interaction with data. 

*What do reports look like in KBase?*

Reports are contained in the output cells generated by KBase Apps. A typical and feature-rich example can be found in KBase's implementation of [DESeq2](https://github.com/kbaseapps/kb_deseq/blob/add70f879a93f060c2b37de914dab7d0c02731c1/lib/kb_deseq/Utils/DESeqUtil.py#L241-L285). 

![DESeq2 Report](http://kbase.us/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/DeSEQ-Capture.png)

*Where do I start with making a report?*

The first step in setting up KBase reports for an App is determining what the outputs of the program are in order to figure out how to best display results or give access to files to users. By understanding what kinds of files, HTML reports, warnings, and other outputs are generated by the program outside of KBase, you can develop a strategy for adequately representing all these within the output cell for your App. The following annotated example code contains all of the parameters that can be set to configure the output:

```python
def _generate_report (self, params, other_stuff):

    # A working example of an app that generates a report for DESeq2
    # https://github.com/kbaseapps/kb_deseq/blob/586714d/lib/kb_deseq/Utils/DESeqUtil.py#L241-L285
    
    report_params = {
         #message is an optional field. It is string that appears in the summary section of the result page
         #eg. message = “This is a message string”

         'message': message_in_app,

         #objects_created: List of typed objects created during
         #the execution of the App. This can only be used to refer
         #to typed objects in the workspace and is separate 
         #from any files generated by the app.

         #eg. 
         #objects_created_in_app = list()
         #objects_created_in_app.append(obj1)
         #objects_created_in_app.append(obj2)
         # See a working example here
         # https://github.com/kbaseapps/kb_deseq/blob/586714d/lib/kb_deseq/Utils/DESeqUtil.py#L262-L264

         'objects_created': objects_created_in_app,

         #warnings: list of strings that can be used to alert the user
         #eg. 
         # warnings_in_app = list()
         # warnings_in_app.append (‘This is warning 1’)
         # warnings_in_app.append (‘This is warning 2’)

         'warnings': warnings_in_app,


         'workspace_name': ws_name,

         #file_links: list of paths or SHOCK node IDs pointing to 
         #a single flat file. They appear in Files section 
         #as list of downloadable files. 
         
         #eg. 
         #  output_files_in_app = list()
         #  output_files_in_app.append({
         #      ‘path’: ‘path to file1 or shock id’,
         #      ‘name’: ‘name of file’,
         #      ‘label’: ‘label of file’,
         #      ‘description’ : ‘Description of file’
         #  }
         
         # To see a working example
         # https://github.com/kbaseapps/kb_deseq/blob/586714d/lib/kb_deseq/Utils/DESeqUtil.py#L205-L239


         'file_links': output_files_in_app,


         #html_links: HTML files that appear in “Links” section. 
         #List of paths or shock node IDs pointing to a single 
         #flat html file or to the top level directory of a website. 
         #The report widget can render one html view directly. 
         #Set one of the following fields to decide which view to render:
         #direct_html - A string with simple html text that will
         #be rendered within the report widget:
         #direct_html_link_index - Integer to specify the index of
         #the page in html_links to view directly in the report widget


         # html_files_in_app = list()
         # html_files_in_app.append({
         #    ‘path’: ‘path to file1 or shock id’,
         #    ‘name’: ‘name of html file1’,
         #    ‘label’: ‘label of html file1’,
         #    ‘description’ : ‘Description of html file1’
         # }
         
         # To see a working example 
         # https://github.com/kbaseapps/kb_deseq/blob/586714d/lib/kb_deseq/Utils/DESeqUtil.py#L86-L194
         

         'html_links': html_files_in_app,
         'direct_html_link_index': 0,

         #html_window_height : Window height - This sets the height
         #of the HTML window displayed under the “Reports” section. 
         #The width is fixed.

         'report_object_name': 'kb_app_name_report_' + str(uuid.uuid4())}

          # Make the client, generate the report
          
          kbase_report_client = KBaseReport(self.callback_url)
          output = kbase_report_client.create_extended_report(report_params)
          
          # Return references which will allow inline display of
          #the report in the Narrative
          
          report_output = {'report_name': output['name'], 
                            'report_ref': output['ref']}
          
          return report_output
  }
  ```

Here's the same example image from above annotated with the parameters used in the creation of the DESeq2 report.
