# KBase SDK - Anatomy of a KBase Module

KBase modules consist of a set of code, configurations, and specifications that describe how a set of related methods are shown in the Narrative interface and define the implementation of a function that is run when the Narrative method is executed.  Eventually, modules will also include components that define visualization widgets, data types, and data uploaders/downloaders/converters.  This guide provides a brief overview of these key components and how they are related.


## Overview

To explore the contents of a module yourself, you can use the kb-sdk tool to create an example module.

    kb-sdk init --example -l python --user YOURUSERNAME MyModule
    cd MyModule
    make

This command will initialize a new Module named MyModule with a prebuilt implementation of an example method.  You should use your own GitHub username instead of YOURUSERNAME.  The generated directory structure will look something like this:

Let's break this down and examine each component.

## The Basics

    MyModule
    ├── README.md
    ├── LICENSE
    ├── kbase.yml

All KBase modules are required to have a kbase.yml file, which is a simple [YAML](http://yaml.org) file that includes basic information and documentation about your Module. This is where you define your Module Name, the set of users that have permission to register/edit this Module, and descriptions of what your Module does.  This information is important for giving you credit for building this module, and is used throughout KBase for describing to users why they should use your Module.

README.md and LICENSE files are also required.  README.md should contain basic information about your module, primarily targeted towards other developers or users who want to browse your code.  A LICENSE file is also required.  Your code will not be approved for release on KBase without a license that is compatible with KBase's [open source license](https://github.com/kbase/project_guides/blob/master/LICENSE).


## Files for building and testing the Module

    MyModule
    ├── Makefile
    ├── deploy.cfg
    ├── .travis.yml

KBase modules are currently all built using `make`, with targets that can rebuild components of your module and start tests.  You can explore the Makefile directly and add additional targets as needed, but you should not have to edit significantly the basic Makefile targets generated by kb-sdk.

When your methods run in KBase, you may need certain configuration variables set.  These are declared in an [INI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/INI_file) configuration file called `deploy.cfg` and may include, for instance, the URL to the KBase data stores and the location of a scratch directory.  Options that you want to be configurable for your module implementation should be placed here (including all URLs), but for the most part you shouldn't have to touch this file very often.

Many modules in KBase can be tested automatically whenever they are pushed into a GitHub repository using [Travis-CI](https://travis-ci.org), and the .travis.yml file is the configuration file for setting up Travis automated tests.  Running full tests in Travis-CI will still be challenging for KBase modules due to data and other KBase dependencies, but we expect to simplify these dependencies and provide .travis.yml templates in the future that are easier to use.


## Dockerfile

    MyModule
    ├── Dockerfile

One of the central components of a KBase module is the [Dockerfile](http://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder).  Nearly all KBase methods are executed within [Docker](http://docker.com) containers so that you can precisely manage your system dependencies and ensure that code that you are testing locally will be run exactly the same way in the KBase system.  Docker images also act like snapshots that allow KBase to maintain and run old versions of your module.  To effectively develop modules in KBase that execute code, you should install Docker locally and familiarize yourself with Docker tools.

Therefore, there are no dependencies files required except for a Dockerfile that can be used to create a Docker image.  Instead, in your Dockerfile, you will define a set of commands that installs any system or package dependencies beyond what is provided in the KBase base image.  


## KBase Interface Description Language (KIDL) Specification File

    MyModule
    ├── MyModule.spec

Your KIDL specification file, often just refered to as your KBase spec file, defines the interface to your code.  This spec file therefore is a critical piece of your module, and is one that you will likely edit frequently.  The interface will be a set of functions with definitions of what they accept as input and what they produce as output.  Using this interface, the KBase platform will know how to call any function in your module in a generic way and search the KBase Catalog for your methods.

There should only be a single KIDL spec file in your module.  Current convention is to name the file with the same name as your module name (e.g., MyModule.spec).

The `kb-sdk` tool can compile your spec file into a set of implementation stubs in either Python, Perl, or Java that you will use to execute your code.  Technical documentation should also be added to spec files, and can be used with the kb-sdk to generate nice looking html documentation for you.

Note: Previously the KIDL spec file was used only to define KBase web services for modules.  In most cases this is no longer required.  Implementation code generated by KIDL specs can be run directly on the command line, and is executed that way for most methods.  In some advanced cases, however, you will need to have a persistant web service so that large data can be cached or some preprocessing can be completed once.  The files generated by the KBase SDK can produce clients (Python, Perl, Java, JavaScript) and server stubs when required, but the KBase platform does not yet have the infrastructure to automate service deployment.  If you think you need this functionality, please [contact us](http://kbase.us/contact-us).

In this simple example of a spec file, there is a single function defined for counting the number of contigs in a contig set. (Note that a "workspace" is like a directory that contains particular data objects.)

    module MyModule {
        /*
        A string representing a ContigSet id.
        */
        typedef string contigset_id;
        
        /*
        A string representing a workspace name.
        */
        typedef string workspace_name;
        
        typedef structure {
            int contig_count;
        } CountContigsResults;
        
        /*
        Count contigs in a ContigSet
        contigset_id - the ContigSet to count.
        */
        funcdef count_contigs(workspace_name,contigset_id) returns (CountContigsResults)
                    authentication required;
    };

## Method Implementation

    MyModule
    ├── lib
    │   ├── MyModule
    │   │   ├── MyModuleImpl.py
    │   │   └── __init__.py
    │   └── README.md

The lib directory is where the actual implmenation code of your method is defined.  In this example, your code consists of a single Python module with a kb-sdk generated Implementation file, which includes stubs that you can can fill in.  In this example there is a single count_contigs method.  When you run `make`, this file is updated and recompiled using `kb-sdk compile` based on any changes in your spec file.  For each function you define in the KIDL spec file, you will see a cooresponding stub that you can fill in.  For example:

    def count_contigs(self, ctx, workspace_name, contigset_id):
        # ctx is the context object
        # return variables are: returnVal
        #BEGIN count_contigs
        token = ctx['token']
        wsClient = workspaceService(self.workspaceURL, token=token)
        contigSet = wsClient.get_objects([{'ref': workspace_name+'/'+contigset_id}])[0]['data']
        returnVal = {'contig_count': len(contigSet['contigs'])}
        #END count_contigs
        
        # At some point might do deeper type checking...
        if not isinstance(returnVal, object):
            raise ValueError('Method count_contigs return value ' +
                             'returnVal is not type object as required.')
        # return the results
        return [returnVal]

Note that your implementation code will be defined between `#BEGIN contig_counts` and `#END contig_counts`.  Any code written outside of these `#BEGIN` and `#END` directives will be overwritten when the implementation file is rebuilt.  The exact code generated by `kb-sdk compile` and structure of the lib directory will of course depend on the programming language you indicated when running `kb-sdk init`.

It is good practice to limit the amount of code you place directly in the implementation files.  Instead, create your own modules and packages that perform most of the logic, and only include calls to those libraries from within the generated Implementation file.


## Narrative Method Specifcations

    MyModule
    └── ui
        ├── README.md
        ├── narrative
        │   └── methods
        │       └── count_contigs_in_set
        │           ├── display.yaml
        │           ├── img
        │           └── spec.json

Methods in the Narrative interface are defined by method specifications that consist of a JSON specification file and a YAML file for documentation and display labels.  In this example, this module has only a single Narrative method defined in a folder named count_contigs_in_set.  This folder name also serves as the method ID. Method IDs must therefore be unique within a module.  You can add more methods simply by adding another directory in the methods folder.

These method specifications indicate what parameters are exposed to the user, how those parameters are selected (e.g., dropdown, text field, checkbox) and how those parameters map to your implementation.  An optional `img` directory allows you to attach screenshots or other images that will automatically be included in the methods detail page for your Narrative method.

Right now you have to write the method specifications by hand, but in the future templates for each method defined in the KIDL specification will be generated.


## Test Framwork

    MyModule
    ├── test
    │   ├── MyModule6_server_test.py
    │   ├── README.md
    │   └── run_tests.sh
    ├── test_local
    │   ├── build_run_tests.sh
    │   ├── readme.txt
    │   ├── run_bash.sh
    │   └── test.cfg

The test directory contains a basic template for performing unit tests of the code in your module implmentation. This is useful for both debugging and ensuring your module is robust and operates well on a range of input data.  The test_local directory is created by `make` to create a scratch space for running tests locally.  It is important that you do not check in any test configuration files with passwords to public git repositories.


## Scripts Directory for Utility/Docker Scripts

    MyModule
    ├── scripts
    │   ├── entrypoint.sh
    │   ├── prepare_deploy_cfg.py
    │   ├── run_async.sh
    │   └── start_server.sh

Your module will include by default a few autogenerated scripts to aid in deployment and to define how your Docker container is run.  For the most part, you can ignore these files.  If you need additional utility scripts, for instance to aid in system dependency installations, fetch a reference data file that needs to be stored in the Docker image, or other methods for testing or validation, you should place them in the scripts directory.


## Technical Documentation

    MyModule
    ├── docs
    │   └── README.md

Any technical documentation or generated API documentation should be placed in the docs directory.


## Narrative and UI Widgets

    MyModule
    └── ui
        └── widgets

Narrative widgets and other UI components cannot yet be defined as part of your module.  This restriction will be lifted eventually.  Until then, this directory is a placeholder.

## Data

    MyModule
    ├── data
    │   └── README.md

New data types, uploaders, and downloaders cannot be defined within modules.  Large amounts of reference data and persistent reference databases are also not supported out of the box for modules.  This restriction will be lifted eventually.  Until then, this directory is a placeholder.  If you require large amounts of reference data for your module, please [contact us](contact-us) for support.
