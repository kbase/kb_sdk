#### <A NAME="repeat"></A>Q: How can I tell if someone's already wrapped a tool I'm interested in?
**A:** Go to the development [App Catalog](https://narrative.kbase.us/#appcatalog) and start by using *Search* see if there's a released method.  If you don't find a method that way, it may also help to  by selecting "Organize by"... "Category" and selecting what seems to be a likely category for the tool.  There are also methods that have not yet been officially released, so you should also check the "Beta" and "Dev" categories to see if there's something in the pipeline by selecting them from the "Version" dropdown.

It may be the case that someone is wrapping a tool, but is doing so in a way that doesn't serve your needs exactly.  Feel free to rewrap the tool using your approach, or ask the previous tool wrapper to tweak their implementation to expose the parameters or other functionality you are looking for.

#### <A NAME="installed"></A>Q: What's already installed in the base KBase Docker image and how do I call it?
**A:**  The base KBase Docker image contains an Ubuntu Linux image with kbase tools for connecting to KBase services and data installed.  Please see the SDK Module implementation [examples](https://github.com/kbase/kb_sdk/README.md#examples) for how to access these services and data.

#### <A NAME="data"></A>Q: How do I find and access data?
**A:** There are both public reference data sets and individual user data sets (both public and private).  Public reference data can be found with [KBase Data Search](https://narrative.kbase.us/search/#/search/?q=*), and should be copied into your Narrative to be used.  Accessing Data Objects from your SDK Methods is explained in [Working with KBase Data Types](https://narrative.kbase.us/#catalog/datatypes) and illustrated in the SDK Module implementation [examples](https://github.com/kbase/kb_sdk/README.md#examples).

#### <A NAME="sys-req-dev"></A>Q: What are system requirements for development workstation?
**A:** You will need to be able to run Docker, which if you're on a Mac means you must be running Mac OS X 10.8 or later.  Other operating systems, such as the various flavors of Linux, are fine too.  Really anywhere you can run Docker, Java, and your preferred development language (among Python, Perl, or Java).  You will need about 1-2 GB free to install the [dependencies](https://github.com/kbase/kb_sdk/docs/kb_sdk_dependencies.md) and the [KBase SDK](https://https://github.com/kbase/kb_sdk/doc/kb_sdk_install_and_build.md).

#### <A NAME="sys-req-exec"></A>Q: What are system requirements for execution environment?
**A:** 
- Runs completely on a standard KBase worker node (at least 2 cores and 22GB memory)
- Operates only on supported KBase data types
- Requires either no or fairly limited amounts of reference data
- Uses existing data visualization widgets
- Does not require new uploaders/downloaders
- Wrapper written in Python, Java, or Perl

#### <A NAME="data-limits"></A>Q: What size data will be too big for the system?
**A:** Currently we support up to about 10 GB of accessory data for a tool (meaning reference DBs, etc).  Please contact us at https://kbase.us/contact-us if you need to use something larger.

As for processing, once it's uploaded to the system (which can take awhile for larger data sets), it depends on how you are using it.  Currently SDK methods are limited in their memory footprint to the 22 GB of the worker nodes, so your code plus any data you load into memory must fit within that.  As in any situation, we recommend the use of graceful exception handling and efficient implementations in your coding style.

#### <A NAME="code-repo"></A>Q: Where should my code be?
**A:** Your SDK Module code should be in a single repo.  That means you can develop on your personal workstation as long as you check in all changes to a public revision control system such as github.com.  For the time being, we ask that you put your code into your own directory rather than in the kbase github account.

#### <A NAME="github-req"></A>Q: Do you need to use GitHub?  What about BitBucket?  SourceForge?
**A:** You can use any public open-source revision control system.  We use GitHub.  The path to your repo is what you provide to the SDK Registration method to register your SDK Module.

#### <A NAME="github-copy"></A>Q: Do I need to copy the tool I'm using into my github repo?
**A:** You do not if there is a public way to retrieve the code such as by using a *git clone*, *curl*, or other way of pulling the data down into the Docker image.  This is accomplished by [modifying the Dockerfile](https://github.com/kbase/kb_sdk/blob/master/doc/kb_sdk_local_test_module.md#dockerfile) to configure the Docker image build.

#### <A NAME="windows"></A>Q: Can I develop on Windows?
**A:**  Sort of.  Your best option right now is to install [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org) with [Ubuntu Linux](https://www.ubuntu.com/desktop) and work in the Linux VM.  Many developers use this approach in KBase, and we know it works well.

#### <A NAME="linux"></A>Q: Can I do all the development on a remote Linux box?
**A:** Yes.  All [graphical-user-interface requiring steps](https://github.com/kbase/kb_sdk/blob/master/doc/kb_sdk_test_in_kbase.md) in the process are accomplished by using a web browser.

#### <A NAME="config-data"></A>Q: How do I add custom data and/or configuration data to the system?
**A:** If it's less than 10 GB, you can add it to the Docker image by [editing the Dockerfile]((https://github.com/kbase/kb_sdk/blob/master/doc/kb_sdk_local_test_module.md#dockerfile).  Please contact us at https://kbase.us/contact-us if you need to use something larger.

#### <A NAME="hpc"></A>Q: I need high-performance computing for my application.  Is that available?
**A:** Not yet.  We're working on it!

#### <A NAME="favorites"></A>Q: How do I set my favorite Apps?
**A:** After logging into [KBase](https://kbase.us), go to the [App Catalog](https://narrative.kbase.us/#appcatalog), and then click on the stars for your favorite Apps.  You must be logged in for it to associate it with your account.

#### <A NAME="cheatsheet"></A>Q: Is there a cheatsheet?
**A:** Yes, there is a document that provides a lot of hints about the SDK [SDK Cheatsheet](SDK_AdvancedFeaturesCheatSheet.pdf).
