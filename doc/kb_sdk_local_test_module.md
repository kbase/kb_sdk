### 7. Locally Test Module and Method(s)

Locally testing your module is a good way of detecting problems with your module's code more quickly (no execution 
queue) and more directly (no UI) than the Narrative interface. Also, a suite of unit tests is required for any module
that will be released to the public ([see full list of release requirements](https://github.com/kbase/project_guides/blob/master/SDK_Guidelines.md)).

#### <A NAME="dockerfile"></A>A. Edit Dockerfile

The base KBase Docker image contains a KBase Ubuntu image, but not much else. You will need to include any dependencies, including the installation of whatever tool you are wrapping, to build a custom Docker image that can run your Module.

For example:

```
RUN \
  git clone https://github.com/voutcn/megahit.git && \
  cd megahit && \
  git checkout tags/v1.0.3 && \
  make
```

Note: you do not have to add any lines to the Dockerfile for installing your SDK Module code, as this will happen automatically.  he contents of your SDK Module git repo will be added at /kb/module.

It is also important to note that layers in the Docker image are generated by each command in the Dockerfile. To make a streamlined Docker image which will deploy on a worker node more quickly and make cycles of Docker image builds faster, it is best to remove any large, extraneous files, such as a tarball from which you installed a tool.

To accomplish this, commands to your Dockerfile should look like this:

```
RUN \
  wget blah.com/tarball.tgz && \
  tar xzf tarball.tgz && \
  cd tarball && \
  make && \
  cd .. && \
  rm -rf tarball.tgz
```

instead of this (**Bad**):

```
RUN wget blah.com/tarball.tgz
RUN tar xzf tarball.tgz
RUN cd tarball
RUN make
RUN cd ..
RUN rm -rf tarball.tgz
```

because the latter does not remove the previous bloating layers, despite the "rm" command.

Final note: Docker will rebuild everything from the first detected change in a dockerfile but pull everything upstream of that from cache. This means that if you are pulling in external data using RUN and a command like `git clone` or `wget` changes in those sources will not automatically be reflected in a rebuilt Docker image unless the Docker file changes at or before that import.

#### <A NAME="get-token"></A>B. Get a developer token

If you have already been approved as a KBase developer, a token can be generated from your [kbase account profile](https://narrative.kbase.us/#auth2/account) under the Developer Tokens tab.

#### <A NAME="build-tests"></A>C. Build tests of your methods

Edit the local test config file (`test_local/test.cfg`) with a developer token (note that this directory is in .gitignore so will not be copied to GitHub. You're safe!):

    test_token = TEST_TOKEN

*In the Docker shell*, run tests:

    cd test_local
    kb-sdk test

This will build your Docker container and execute all test scripts in the test directory.
The example module already has tests implemented in `test/python_server_test.py`, which creates
a testing workspace, uploads test data and runs the filter_contigs method. After tests are 
run for the first time, a new `workdir/tmp` directory will appear in `test_local` which is
the scratch directory from the preceding run. Inspecting these intermediate files can be very
helpful for debugging.

Additionally, you can inspect the file structure of the Docker container to see whether your
wrapped tool was installed properly, by opening a bash console. From the `test_local` directory:
    
    ./run_bash.sh

Unfortunately, you will have to rebuild the Docker image each time you change your module code 
(e.g. KIDL \<MyModule\>.spec, \<MyModule\>Impl.py, and your testing code) but this happens 
automatically for you when you run *kb-sdk test*, so it just slows you down rather than adding 
any extra effort. However, if you change the KIDL \<MyModule\>.spec file, you will have to 
rerun *make* to propagate those changes to the \<MyModule\>Client and \<MyModule\>Impl code 
(and likely will have some tweaks to apply to the Impl code to match the spec changes). 
Following [Dockerfile Best Practices](https://docs.docker.com/engine/userguide/eng-image/dockerfile_best-practices)
like leveraging layer caching can greatly speed up your test process. Happy debugging!

**(Don't forget to *git commit* and *git push* your edits to your GitHub repo!)**
