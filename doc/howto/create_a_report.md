# How to create a KBaseReport

The [KBaseReport](https://appdev.kbase.us/#catalog/modules/KBaseReport) module allows the creation of KBase reports which can present text, HTML, and downloadable files to the user as output to your app. The KBaseReports module is the preferred way to communicate results to users.

*Why do I need to make a report?*

Reports in KBase allow a developer to present visualizations, generate human-readable text strings, show warnings, provide links to output files that do not correspond to typed objects, and in general display information that is useful to a user without having to utilize kbase-ui widgets. 

*What kinds of reports can I make?*

Developers can use the KBaseReports module to display and contain a wide variety of content. It's up to each developer to determine how to creatively and effectively integrate this module with their Apps. Reports can be configured in a variety of ways, depending on how the parameters to parse and display the outputs of an App are configured. We will cover an example and some sample code, but exploring the variety of existing Apps and their output reports within the KBase Narratives will best demonstrate the capabilities of this module. Many developers have used the ability to contain and display HTML files within the reports for visualization of and interaction with data. 

*What do reports look like in KBase?*

Reports are contained in the output cells generated by KBase Apps. A typical and feature-rich example can be found in KBase's implementation of [DESeq2](https://github.com/kbaseapps/kb_deseq/blob/add70f879a93f060c2b37de914dab7d0c02731c1/lib/kb_deseq/Utils/DESeqUtil.py#L241-L285).

The first step in setting up KBase reports for an App is determining what the outputs of the program are in order to figure out how to best display results or give access to files to users. By understanding what kinds of files, HTML reports, warnings, and other outputs are generated by the program outside of KBase, you can develop a strategy for adequately representing all these within the output cell for your App. The following annotated example code contains all of the parameters that can be set to configure the output:

Here's the same example image from above annotated with the parameters used in the creation of the DESeq2 report.
