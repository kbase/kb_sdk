# $module_name
---

A [KBase](https://kbase.us) module generated by the [KBase SDK](https://github.com/kbase/kb_sdk).


#if ($example)
This Module was initialized with a generated example App.  To compile and run the
example App implementation, run:

    cd $module_name
    make          (required after making changes to $module_name.spec)
    kb-sdk test   (will require setting test user account credentials in test_local/test.cfg)

For more help on how to modify, register and deploy the example to KBase, see the
[KBase SDK documentation](https://github.com/kbase/kb_sdk).
